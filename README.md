Bookshelf

Repo for my CS 4550 Final Project entitled 'Bookshelf'

This is a MEAN stack application that allows a user to search for books by title using the googlebooks api (https://developers.google.com/books/) and save favorites to a profile. A registered user may also view fellow users favorites lists to get ideas for books they may also enjoy.
